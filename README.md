# shortest-code.github.io

Shortest code that I've done in our coding activity at school, as shown below:

## Activity instructions
Create two web pages in HTML and JavaScript with scripts that will do the following:

+ The first web page is named as `start.html`. When this page gets loaded, it will display a dialog box that will give a message that the user will be redirected to the `second.html` web page.  Research the use of `window.open()` to actually go to `second.html`.

  Objectives:
  1. Use of event handler with function call
  2. Definition of the function
  3. Dialog box to display the message
  4. The use of `window.open()` to to the second page

+ In the second.html, display two buttons using the `<button>` tag and an image. The first button when clicked will replace the image with another one while the second button will revert it back to the original image.  Research the use of the `<button>` tag and images would be up to you.

  Objectives:
  1. Two buttons
  2. Assigned event handlers with function calls
  3. Process to toggle between two images

+ Timeliness
